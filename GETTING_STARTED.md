# Getting Started with AutoFooocus

## What is AutoFooocus?

AutoFooocus is an automated batch processing system for Fooocus that helps you:
- Test different AI model combinations automatically
- Find the best settings for your prompts
- Compare results from multiple models side-by-side
- Organize and analyze generated images

## Quick 5-Minute Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AutoFooocus
```

2. **Check your system**
```bash
./check_setup.sh
```

3. **Complete setup** (downloads ~13GB of AI models)
```bash
make setup
```

4. **Test it out**
```bash
make test-single PROMPT="beautiful mountain landscape"
```

## What Happens During Setup

- âœ… Clones Fooocus from GitHub
- âœ… Creates Python virtual environment  
- âœ… Installs all dependencies
- âœ… Copies AutoFooocus scripts
- âœ… Downloads essential AI models
- âœ… Ready to generate images!

## Your First Generation

```bash
# Single image with custom settings
make test-single PROMPT="cyberpunk cityscape" STEPS=25 COUNT=2

# Batch test with multiple prompts and models
make test-batch

# View results in browser
make view-results
```

## What You Get

After running `make setup`, your directory looks like:

```
AutoFooocus/
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile              # Automation commands
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Full documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/              # Custom processing scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ configs/              # Configuration templates
â””â”€â”€ Fooocus/              # Complete Fooocus installation
    â”œâ”€â”€ models/           # Downloaded AI models
    â””â”€â”€ batch_outputs/    # Your generated images
```

## Next Steps

1. **Experiment with prompts**: Try different artistic styles and subjects
2. **Test model combinations**: See which models work best for your use case
3. **Analyze results**: Use the HTML viewer to compare outputs
4. **Create custom configs**: Design your own batch processing workflows
