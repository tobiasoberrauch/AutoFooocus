Thank you for your interest in contributing to AutoFooocus! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **üêõ Bug Reports**: Report issues you encounter
- **‚ú® Feature Requests**: Suggest new functionality  
- **üìù Documentation**: Improve guides and documentation
- **üîß Code Improvements**: Bug fixes and optimizations
- **üß™ Testing**: Platform testing and validation
- **üé® Device Optimization**: CUDA/MPS/CPU improvements

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AutoFooocus.git
   cd AutoFooocus
   ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

3. **Test Your Setup**
   ```bash
   make test-single PROMPT="test contribution setup"
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Shell Scripts**: Follow bash best practices
  - Use `set -e` for error handling
  - Quote variables: `"$variable"`
  - Use meaningful function names
  - Add help text for all scripts

- **Python Scripts**: Follow PEP 8
  - Use type hints where possible
  - Add docstrings for functions
  - Handle errors gracefully
  - Optimize for different devices

- **Makefile**: Keep targets simple and clear
  - One responsibility per target
  - Use shell scripts for complex logic
  - Add help text for all targets

### Architecture Principles

1. **Shell-First**: Primary automation in shell/Makefile
2. **Device Agnostic**: Support CUDA, MPS, and CPU
3. **Self-Contained**: Minimal external dependencies
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages and progress indicators
5. **Modular**: Independent, testable components

## üîß Device Optimization

### CUDA Optimization
- Focus on memory efficiency for different VRAM sizes
- Implement batch processing for high-end GPUs
- Use fp16 precision where stable
- Test on various NVIDIA architectures

### MPS (Apple Silicon) Optimization  
- Handle MPS-specific limitations
- Implement proper fallback mechanisms
- Optimize for unified memory architecture
- Test on M1/M2/M3 chips

### CPU Optimization
- Reduce computational complexity
- Implement resolution scaling
- Use efficient schedulers/samplers
- Optimize for multi-core systems

## üß™ Testing

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test device detection
./scripts/device_optimizer.py

# Test basic functionality
make test-single PROMPT="test prompt"

# Test device-specific configs
make test-config # Uses device-optimized config

# Test model downloads
make download-recommended
```

### Platform Testing

Please test on multiple platforms:
- **Linux**: CUDA support, various distributions
- **macOS**: MPS support, Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Windows**: WSL and native support

### Performance Testing

When contributing optimizations:
- Measure generation time improvements
- Monitor memory usage
- Test with different model sizes
- Document performance gains

## üìù Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**
   - Follow coding guidelines
   - Add/update documentation
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes  
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Testing improvements

Examples:
```
